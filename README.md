# Uniqueness-fu!

A game where you try to pick the least popular move (out of a potentially procedurally generated moveset) every round!

Details on initial design can be found at the [wiki](https://github.com/calpoop/uniqueness-fu/wiki), [this page](https://github.com/calpoop/uniqueness-fu/wiki/Initial-Design) to be exact.

Also for collaboraters (ahem @ahl1395) refer to the [Discussions](https://github.com/calpoop/uniqueness-fu/discussions) page to discuss ideas and stuff so we ain't just on Bnet.
